	abstract = {Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are widely used in industrial applications. Ensuring the correctness of PLC programs is important due to their safety-critical nature. Structured text (ST) is an imperative programming language for PLC. Despite recent advances in executable semantics of PLC ST, existing methods neglect complex multitasking and preemption features. This paper presents an executable semantics of PLC ST with preemptive multitasking. Formal analysis of multitasking programs experiences the state explosion problem. To mitigate this problem, this paper also proposes state space reduction techniques for model checking multitask PLC ST programs. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {SCADA systems play an important role in tracking the behaviour of critical process variables and connecting geographically dispersed subsystems at the industrial plant level. This article presents a PLC and SCADA-based control framework to automate and supervise the temperature control processes in the heat exchanger plant. The OMRON (NX1P2-9024DT1) PLC is interfaced with the Wonderware InTouch SCADA system to gather data, create a simulated temperature control prototype and carry out the necessary control operations within the heat exchanger plant. The PLC controls the entire process and programming of PLC is done using Sysmac studio automation software using the ladder programming language. The proposed system controls the temperature of the heat exchanger system through PID and Fractional Order PID (P IλDμ) controllers with Integral Anti-windup technique. Various control strategies like Cascade Control, Feedforward Control and Smith Predictor for time delayed process are discussed for controlling the temperature of the process. The performance of both PID and fractional order PID controllers is optimized using adaptive heuristic optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In control system design and analysis, the calculated performance indices are used as quantitative measures for evaluating the performance of a system. The combined form of temperature controller with Cascade control, Feedforward control and dead-time compensator is modelled and examined for simulation using MATLAB. Simulation and real-time experimentation analysis of the developed controllers are executed with metaheuristic optimization techniques based on different performance indices like ISE, IAE and ITAE. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Petri nets (PNs) are typically used for design and verification rather than direct control implementation. In this paper, aligning with the Industry 4.0 paradigm's focus on flexible and reconfigurable control systems, we propose a modelling tool for rapidly prototyping feedback-based discrete-event control algorithms on programmable controllers such as PLCs or microcontroller boards. This modelling tool, named Signal Interpreted Coloured Petri Nets (SICPNs), aims to combine the formal modelling expressiveness of Coloured PNs with the capabilities of Signal Interpreted PNs, which are specialised in processing plant measurements and determining actuator commands. This contribution involves: (a) the formal definition of SICPN; (b) the presentation in the IEC61131-3 compliant SCL language of the so-called Token Player, a software entity designed to support feedback-based decision-making within the SICPN; (c) the validation of the effectiveness of the proposed formalism in controlling an extended configuration of the FESTO Modular Processing Station (MPS) using an Arduino microcontroller via two-way UART serial communications; (d) the modelling of a Digital Twin of the FESTO MPS testbed. The tests demonstrate that, during transitions, the colour and signal interpretation conditions enable the microcontroller to accurately schedule and dynamically reconfigure control actions while keeping the size of the PN-based controller small relative to the control problem's complexity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The system's control is vested in a programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Both hardware and software components constitute this project's essence. On the hardware side, it involves the creation and assembly of essential elements such as a conveyor for object transportation, height-sensing sensors, electronic systems for sorting, and conveyor belt propulsion motors. The software facet encompasses ladder logic programming, executed through GX Works 2 software seamlessly integrated with the FX3U-24MR PLC. Throughout this investigation, four distinct conceptual designs were formulated, each subsequently evaluated using the Pugh Evaluation Matrix. The chosen design was then meticulously translated into a 3-dimensional model using SolidWorks software. This step was instrumental in providing enhanced comprehension and visualization of the proposed concept before moving on to fabrication. The successful realization of this project's goals was achieved through a harmonious interplay of hardware and software components.

	abstract = {PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) based data collection is integral to industrial automation and data acquisition processes. The pipeline – between the device and the database – is a complex system with many components and often causes some time delay, due to the synchronization and the applied hardware and software components. This delay can also lead to data loss on the database site. In this study, we aimed to examine this problem connected to the synchronized behavior of four counter networks within the TIA software for PLCs, particularly focusing on the implications of a 1 Hz (Hz) clock frequency on counter synchronization. Meticulous experiments were conducted and the integration of Node-RED, as an instrumental tool in industrial automation, facilitated counter-behavior monitoring. Recorded values of counter and timestamps were meticulously stored in four separate databases (MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Apache Cassandra) for comprehensive data analysis. Throughout the experiments, inconsistencies in the counter values were encountered, leading to the discovery of missing values that varied across the ten tests. To detect the reason, a unique delay calculation method was developed. According to our results, we were able to do post-synchronization with millisecond-level accuracy. It can help reveal the missing values that depend on the Node-RED and the PLC cycle time differences. © 2024},

	abstract = {In smart industries, a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is necessary to control system functions that confirm to work according to requirements. Furthermore, the testing of PLC functions should be carried out in a very short time with very good accuracy and high reliability, but at the lowest cost possible. This paper presents the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) for PLC functions. The objective of this paper is to design low-cost ATE from commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) with ease of testing. A model-based systems engineering approach is used to design the tester. The ATE design uses the open-source Capella tool, which supports the Architecture Analysis and Design Integrated Approach (ARCADIA) method. The structural elements of the ATE system are the test controller, the switching relays, the system software, and the Human-Machine Interface (HMI), which is used to display the test results. The test controller executes the test program and controls the inputs of the PLC under test using the test patterns via switching relays. The responses from the outputs of the PLC are sent to the inputs of the test controller and compared with the expected responses. The results of PLC function testing are displayed on the HMI. The results show that the maximum speed of the ATE is 10 ms/pattern, and the total cost is under 140 USD. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the safety and protection measures implemented in the High Heat Flux Test Facility (HHFTF). The interlock system has been enhanced and integrated into HHFTF to ensure the protection of the facility and the safety of personnel, thereby mitigating risks during operations. The primary purpose of these interlocks is to secure the entire facility under well-defined conditions to prevent accidents. The safety and interlock protection system constitute integral components of HHFTF's overall control system, providing the capability to manage various subsystems, many of these systems are operated reliably close to their performance limits in order to achieve the desired goals. The overall safety, interlock protection and the control system encompasses both hardware components and software, employing Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), along with wired logic based on relays and special logic cards. Three different types of architecture have been developed: (1) Slow Architecture based on PLCs, for functions where response time of longer than 20 ms is adequate; (2) Fast Architecture based on FPGAs, for functions requiring fast response time beyond the capabilities of the PLC; and (3) Hardwired Architecture for critical functions. The paper showcases the successful testing and outcomes of an enhanced interlock protection system, encompassing both software and critical hardwired interlocks, within the HHFTF. Key parameters monitored include the maximum allowable job threshold temperature, flow rates (for coolant loss detection), and chamber pressure. Activation times of interlocks were observed within a range from 100 microseconds to 116 milliseconds. © 2024},

	abstract = {Recently released scan data on Shodan reveals that thousands of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) worldwide are directly accessible via the Internet and, thus, exposed to cyber-attacks aiming at financial gain, espionage, or disruption and/or sabotage. Executing sophisticated cyber–physical attacks aiming to manipulate industrial functionalities requires a deep understanding of the underlying physical process at the core of the target ICS, for instance, through unauthorized access to memory registers of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). However, to date, countermeasures aiming at hindering the comprehension of physical processes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the use of obfuscation strategies to complicate process comprehension of ICSs while preserving their runtime evolution. To this end, we propose a framework to design and evaluate obfuscation strategies for PLCs, involving PLC memory registers, PLC code (user program), and the introduction of extra (spurious) physical processes. Our framework categorizes obfuscation strategies based on two dimensions: the type of (spurious) registers employed in the obfuscation strategy and the dependence on the (genuine) physical process. To evaluate the efficacy of proposed obfuscation strategies, we introduce evaluation metrics to assess their potency and resilience, in terms of system invariants the attacker can derive, and their cost in terms of computational overhead due to runtime modifications of spurious PLC registers. We developed a prototype tool to automatize the devised obfuscation strategies and applied them to a non-trivial use case in the field of water tank systems. Our results show that code obfuscation can be effectively used to counter malicious process comprehension of ICSs achieved via scanning of PLC memory registers. To our knowledge, this is the first work using obfuscation as a technique to protect ICSs from such threats. The efficacy of the proposed obfuscation strategies predominantly depends on the intrinsic complexity of the interplay introduced between genuine and spurious registers. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {A cryptography algorithm for data transfer encryption provides confidentiality, requires considerable computing power, and is not commonly implemented in embedded systems with limited computing power, such as Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). PLC is the core component for automation and control in industrial automation. For decades, PLC has prioritized speed over security; program execution in PLC must be as efficient as possible. The cryptography algorithm uses a seed, the initialization vector, to encrypt the data with the cryptography key to strengthen the encryption. Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) can be used as the initialization vector. This paper proposes the XORasm PRNG algorithm, the lightweight XORshift-based algorithm with a modified seed from the system’s clock. The applied methodology generates and visualizes PRNG, tests the randomness, and implements the PRNG on compact PLC. XORasm is evaluated statistically with runs-test in simulation by comparing the algorithm to one of the simulated compact PLC’s PRNG implementations. The findings from this research are that p-values demonstrate that XORasm is statistically and significantly more random than the current implementation, and there is evidence that XORasm’s generated data distribution is practically random at a 99.95% confidence level, suitable for implementation in embedded systems as a lightweight PRNG.
