We propose source code level metrics to measure size, vocabulary, cognitive complexity and testing complexity of a visual Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming language. We present metrics for Ladder Diagram (LD) programming language which is one of the five languages defined in the IEC 61131-3 standard.

With the increasing size and complexity of PLC programs, the traditional manual test cannot meet the needs of industrial fields due to its inefficiency and error-prone features. Program slicing is a method of program analysis and understanding. Based on some slicing criterion, it removes the irrelevant statements from the source code to obtain a group of interested program segments. In this way, the scope of the program under study is narrowed. In this paper, program slicing of PLC programs will be studied. The slicing of PLC programs needs special treatment which is usually not necessary in other software written in high level language or assembly language. For example, PLC programs run in cyclic operating mode, and they usually allow each ladder to include more than one output ports making the number of outputs in one statement much larger than that of those in other software. We first introduce a ladder transformation as a preparation for program slicing. Then algorithms for static slicing for PLC programs are proposed. A demo is given to show that this method can effectively reduce the scale of program.","2161-2927","978-7-8946-3104-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5572887","PLC Program;Ladder Transformation;Static Slicing;Cyclic Slice","Grammar;Input variables;Arrays;Registers;Computer languages;Software;Service robots","","","1","9","","20 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting from dream of a man to be free of the drudgery of manual labor using automatic device, until currently in 21st century where robot has been applied to almost all types of labor industries. This project is motivated by the lack of application in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) as mobile robot navigation system. By developing an algorithm and analyzing the navigation of mobile robot using PLC, the mobile robot should be able to follow line hypothetically. An experiment was conducted as the method to prove the hypothesis. Starting with designing the program using PLC software until assigning the PLC into the mobile robot with complete circuit wiring. To analyze the navigation of mobile robot, navigation experiment is done in straight line which is repeated for 5 times and represented in line graph. From 20 mark points measured for each running time, it shows that error is lest then 18% which prove that the mobile robot able to navigate using PLC. At the end of the experiment, the result showed the ultimate goal of this project has been achieved by moving the mobile robot using PLC based controller mobile system and enable the mobile robot to read and following the line.","","978-1-4673-7971-7","10.1109/URAI.2015.7358816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358816","Mobile Robot;Programmable Logic Controller (PLC);Navigation","Mobile robots;Navigation;Wheels;Service robots;Robot sensing systems","","2","","3","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This provides an added advantage of automation and control with an ease operation and speedy network. A 6V DC input is given to stepper motor STM 981 which is connected to the conveyer belt for its movement. Once the material is sensed by the proximity sensor, then the conveyer belt gets stopped whereas the robotic arm picks the material from the conveyer belt and places it in the required site. The output signal from the robotic arm will be given to the PLC namely Siemens S7 1200 and further it is connected to 24 port-switches. Also, personal computer, IoT 2040 Gateway and Human Machine Interface (HMI) will be connected to the switch. Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) is a portal used to write ladder logic programming for PLC. For communicating PLC with IoT2040 gateway, python code will be written in software called MobaXterm. Also, python program is written in the same software for communicating IoT2040 gateway with Cloud and Cloud with PLC through IoT2040.

We all are know, now a days, Elevator is an important transport medium in multi-storage building for vertical transportation. Preliminarily, traditional elevator control systems are works under relay logic, which contains more number of connections [2]. Hence it has become more difficult to debug the failures in the system and also it is highly feasible to alternate the connections.. Therefore, here we use programmable logic controller to build the elevator model. To control the motion of the elevator we use DC geared motor. Here, we use buttons to give signals to the elevator to come to the desired floor. Here we selected Ladder diagram programming. Because, it is easy to program the PLC.

A Programmable Logic Controller is a solid state user programmable control system with functions to control logic, sequencing, timing, arithmetic data manipulation and counting capabilities. As the applications are becoming more and more complex, the single-core PLCs are unable to meet the high speed execution requirements, so there is a need for high performance PLCs. Scan time is one of the important parameter which determines the performance of PLC. This paper presents an Optimal Software PLC (Soft-PLC) developed using python programming language which runs on multicore processor. The key feature of this Soft-PLC is the identification and parallel execution of independent rungs of ladder logic on multiple core. Our Soft-PLC provides high speed execution and low scan time compared to PLCs which run on single core processor.","","978-1-5386-1716-8","10.1109/ICMDCS.2017.8211691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211691","ladder logic;multicore PLC;scantime;soft-PLC","Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Time measurement;Software;Sensors;Standards;Programming","","5","","5","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
